## Candy Shop

#### Feature #1: 

As a guest, I can visit `'/shops'` and see a list of all shops in the database. Each shop should be link to the shop's show page. A shop should have a name. 

#### Feature #2: 

As a guest, I can visit `'/shops/:id'` and see the shop's name along with items that belong to that specific shop. Each item should be a link to the item's show page. I should not see items that belong to a different shop. 

At the top of the page, I should see the total potential revenue for those items (ie - how much would the shop make if they sold every item in the store?).

#### Feature #3:

As a guest, I can visit `'/items/:id'` and see the item's name, description, and retail price. I should also see what the price of the item would be with a 20% discount.
